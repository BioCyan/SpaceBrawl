# SpaceBrawl
SpaceBrawl is a simple space shooter game where the players shoots asteroids to 
gain points while orbiting a star. It uses JavaFX for both its menus and 3D
features.

# Building and Running
First clone the repo into a project folder with 
`git clone https://github.com/BioCyan/SpaceBrawl.git` and import it into your
IDE of choice. The repo contains an Eclipse project that depends on JavaFX 8. If
you are using a newer version of Java than 8, you will likely need to configure
the JavaFX depedency manually. Make sure the resources folder is marked as a 
source folder to allow the program to access it. Once both JavaFX and the 
resource folder are set up, the project should compile and run normally.

# Using
By default the controls use the mouse to turn the camera,
the left mouse button to fire projectiles, WASD for sideways and forward
acceleration, Shift and Control for upwards and downwards acceleration 
respectively, and Escape to enter the pause menu. Settings to change some of the
controls and mouse senstivity can be accessed from both the main menu and the
pause menu.
